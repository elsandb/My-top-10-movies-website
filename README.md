# My-top-10-movies-website
This project is my solution to the challenge given on day 64 of the Udemy-course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

All CSS, and all HTML code (except code that connect to other files - like Jinja2-templates) were given in the project starting files.

Actual goal:
- To use SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF (FlaskForm), Flask-Bootstrap and API calls in one Flask-app.

Goal: 
- Make a website where the user can search for movie titles (via API requests to The movie database https://www.themoviedb.org/), 
and add movies to their top-10(-ish)-list (which is based on a SQLite3 database).
